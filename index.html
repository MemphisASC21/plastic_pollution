    <p> Thank you for visiting out site. Our plan is to make sure that all marine life animals are all safe from the harm of plastic and other types 
        of debris. If you would like to, please donate to us on our donation category where you can donate us much as you want. A ten dollar donation
        can save an animal from getting tangled into debris. Please don't let another marine animal die from a debris.
    </p>
